# 0x09. C - Static libraries

## 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libholberton.a and holberton.h file that contain all the prototypes of the functions
#### File: libholberton.a, holberton.h

## 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory
#### File: create_static_lib.sh
