# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Learning Objectives

- What do LIFO and FIFO mean
- What is a stack, and when to use it
- What is a queue, and when to use it
- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- What is the proper way to use global variables
- How to work with git submodules

#### Data structures

Please use the following data structures for this project. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

```
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;
```

```
/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```
